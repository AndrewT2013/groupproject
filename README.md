# Summary (Original Versus Updated Code):
  The original code was focused on an application that would calculate the sales tax applied to the item prices of a transaction that have been inputted by a user. The sales tax applied was dependent on Monterey County's sales tax rate, which allowed the code to apply the appropriate sales tax to the inputted transaction to achieve three different results: total without tax, sales tax applied, and total with tax. These results would then be displayed within the application's interface for the user. (Original code created by Andrew Traphagan)
  Our updated code focuses on an application that calculates the sales tax applied to the item prices of a transaction that has been inputted by a user. The sales tax applied will dependent on the county of purchase within the state of California, and these counties will be presented to the user for selection. This will allow the code to apply the appropriate sales tax to the inputted transaction to achieve three different results: total without tax, sales tax applied, and total with tax. These results will be displayed within the application's interface for the user. (Updated code created by Andrew Traphagan, Athena Lee, Jacob Holback, Khushi Desai, & Rebecca Blasco)
