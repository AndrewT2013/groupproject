# Summary:
  An application that calculates the sales tax applied to item prices of a transaction that has been inputted by a user. The sales tax applied will depend on the county of purchase within the state of California, and these counties will be presented to the user for selection. This will allow the code to apply the appropriate sales tax to the inputted transaction to achieve three different results: total without tax, sales tax applied, and total with tax. These results will be displayed within the application's interface for the user.
