## **Summary & Purpose:**
  ### _Original Code:_
  ##### The original code focused on an application that would calculate the sales tax applied to the item prices of a transaction that have been inputted by a user. The sales tax applied was dependent on Monterey County's sales tax rate, which allowed the code to apply the appropriate sales tax to the inputted transaction to    achieve three different results: total without tax, sales tax applied, and total with tax. These results would then be displayed within the application's interface       for the user. (Original code created by Andrew Traphagan)
  ### _Updated Code:_
  ##### Our updated code focuses on an application that calculates the sales tax applied to the item prices of a transaction that has been inputted by a user. The      sales tax applied will dependent on the county of purchase within the United States, and these counties will be presented via an API to the user for input via a postal/zip code. This will allow the code to apply the appropriate sales tax to the inputted transaction to achieve three different results: total without tax, sales tax applied, and total with tax. These results will be displayed within the application's interface for the user. (Updated code created by Andrew Traphagan, Athena Lee, Jacob Holback, Khushi Desai, & Rebecca Blasco)
  ### _Purpose:_
  ##### This new application is aimed at making it easier for users to calculate how much they are going to be spending at a physical and/or some online store          environments for their desired items rather than purchasing these items without knowing how much tax will be applied to their transaction(s).
